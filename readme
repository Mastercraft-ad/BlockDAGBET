🚀 DAGBet – Hackathon Meme Prediction Market
📌 Overview

DAGBet is a decentralized prediction market built on BlockDAG Layer 1, where participants can bet on fun meme markets about the hackathon itself.
Example markets:

“Will our team place top 3?”

“Will the hackathon finish on time?”

By making prediction markets fun, interactive, and on-chain, DAGBet keeps judges, participants, and the audience engaged in real-time.

🎯 Problem Statement

Hackathons often lack engagement tools that keep participants and spectators actively involved.

Traditional betting platforms are centralized and don’t fit the hackathon theme.

No easy way to gamify hackathon participation using blockchain.

💡 Our Solution

DAGBet provides:

Meme Markets → Fun, hackathon-themed predictions.

On-Chain Transparency → Smart contracts handle bets and payouts.

Gamification → Keeps participants entertained during breaks or waiting times.

Decentralized Oracles → Judges/admins resolve outcomes fairly.

⚙️ How It Works

Create Market → Admin sets up a hackathon question.

Place Bet → Users bet YES/NO using crypto.

Resolve Market → Admin declares the outcome.

Redeem Winnings → Winners claim their share of the prize pool.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Smart Contract: Solidity (DAGBet.sol) deployed on BlockDAG L1.

Frontend: React (ethers.js for wallet & contract interaction).

Wallet: MetaMask or BlockDAG Wallet.
